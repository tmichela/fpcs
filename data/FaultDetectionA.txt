FaultDetectionA and FaultDetectionB are subsets taken from the FaultDetection dataset [1], https://mb.uni-paderborn.de/en/kat/main-research/datacenter/bearing-datacenter/data-sets-and-download,
 which is gathered from an electromechanical drive system that monitors the condition of
rolling bearings and detect damages in them. There are four subsets of
data collected under various conditions, whose parameters include
rotational speed, load torque, and radial force. 

FaultDetectionA has three classes, the distribution of which is unbalanced, but identical in the train and test sets.

[0.09090909 0.45454545 0.45454545]
<ol>
<li> undamaged (9.09%)
<li> inner damaged (45.55%)
<li> outer damaged (45.55%)
</ol>

Each original recording has a single channel with sampling frequency of 64k Hz and lasts 4 seconds. The data we host was processed with a sliding window in [2] to produce more cases. 
The data were split in [1] into 8184 train cases, 2728 validation and 2728 test. We have added the validation set to the end of the train file to ease reproduction if a validation set is needed. 
We are not aware of whether the original recordings were separated in the train and test.
